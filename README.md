# Coding Sandbox for C++

Repo contains solutions for data structures and problem solving in C++.

Makes use of some parts of SÃ©bastien Rombauts [Cpp-Skeleton](https://github.com/SRombauts/cpp-skeleton) for basic utility functions such as timers, and includes the [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) headers as a test suite.

Visual Studio 2017 projects and solution files can be created using CMake and `build.bat` script or:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
```
